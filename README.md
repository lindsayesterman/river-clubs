# River Clubs

These are some starter files for the Spanish River Girls Who Code 2020-2021 project. We are making a club finder app that holds all of Spanish River's Clubs' information.

**The problem**

Eliona: "Sally, I've looked everywhere but I can't find information on what time our Girls Who Code club meeting is." 

Sally: "Oh yeah, you have to watch the announcements today to find that info. They're ONLY 20 mins long."

**The Solution**

A directory containing all of River's Clubs' information.

The River Clubs website can store meeting times, meeting places, a club description, the google classroom and remind codes, and the leadership team.

Now students can browse through clubs to join and find information regarding clubs they are already in. 

We no longer have to waste 20 minutes watching a video for 10 seconds of information.
