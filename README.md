# Club Finder

These are some starter files for the Spanish River Girls Who Code 2020-2021 project. We are making a club finder app that holds all schools' clubs' information.

**The problem**

Eliona: "Sally, I've looked everywhere but I can't find information on what time our Girls Who Code club meeting is." 

Sally: "Oh yeah, you have to text someone in the club or watch the announcements today to find that info. It's 20 mins long this morning. "

**The Solution**

Eliona: "Sally, do you know where to find information on what time the GWC meeting is?" 

Sally: "Oh yeah, just check out https://river-clubs.vercel.app/, you can see everything about different clubs' meeting information there."

**The App**

A directory containing schools' clubs' information.

The Club Finder website can store meeting times, meeting places, a club description, the google classroom and remind codes, and the leadership team.

Now students can browse through clubs to join and find information regarding clubs they are already in.
